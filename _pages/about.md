The Evolution of Cells, Symbionts, and Organelles (ECSO) Lab at Purdue University (IN, USA) opened its doors in January 2023. We will investigate the evolutionary and mechanistic causes of both ancient and more recent symbioses. Two of the immediate research interests of the lab are (**1**) the origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria, and (**2**) the origin and function of purple symbioses.

Some of the questions we will be tackling are:

- What was the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor? 
- What was the genetic contribution of the mitochondrial ancestor to eukaryotes? 
- How did mitochondria affect the physiology and evolution of eukaryotes? 
- What are the mechanistic bases of purple photosymbioses? 
- How have purple photosymbioses evolved?
  
See our research [here](https://sergiophyceae.github.io/research/) to learn more.

I'm currently looking for a bioinformatician to join as a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://sergiophyceae.github.io/positions/) and a microbiologist to join as a [Research Associate](https://sergiophyceae.github.io/positions/). I will also be recuiting graduate students soon. If you are a motivated student interested in symbiosis and cell evolution and are looking for a PhD, do get in touch!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
