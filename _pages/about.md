The Evolution of Cells, Symbionts, and Organelles (ECSO) Lab at Purdue University (IN, USA) opened its doors in January 2023. We will investigate the evolutionary and mechanistic causes of both ancient and more recent symbioses. Two of the immediate research interests of the lab are (**1**) the origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria, and (**2**) the origin and function of purple symbioses.

Some of the questions we will be tackling are:

- What was the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor? 
- What was the genetic contribution of the mitochondrial ancestor to eukaryotes? 
- How did mitochondria affect the physiology and evolution of eukaryotes? 
- What are the mechanistic bases of purple photosymbioses? 
- How have purple photosymbioses evolved?

I'm currently looking for a bioinformatician to join as a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://sergiophyceae.github.io/positions/) and a microbiologist to join as a [Research Associate](https://sergiophyceae.github.io/positions/). I will also be recuiting graduate students soon. If you are a motivated student interested in symbiosis and cell evolution and are looking for a PhD, do get in touch!
