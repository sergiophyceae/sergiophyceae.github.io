Welcome to the **Evolution of Cells, Symbionts, and Organelles** Lab website! We are located in the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) (IN, USA). We are part of the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Research Area](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/ecology/) and the [Center for Plant Biology](https://ag.purdue.edu/cpb/). One of the central questions that drive our research is ‘**How does cellular complexity increase?**’ Our research thus focuses on **major transitions in cell evolution**. Two of the immediate interests of the lab are (1) the **origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria**, and (2) the **origin and function of purple photosymbioses**.

Some of the questions we are tackling include:

- What was the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor? 
- What was the genetic contribution of the mitochondrial ancestor to eukaryotes? 
- How did mitochondria affect the physiology and evolution of eukaryotes? 
- What are the mechanistic bases of purple photosymbioses? 
- How have purple photosymbioses evolved?

## Opportunities

I am always looking for highly motivated **students** to join the ECSO Lab! If you are passionate about symbiosis and cell evolution, please do get in touch to discuss possibilities. If you are a student that belongs to an underrepresented or minority group, consider applying to the [Graduate Diversity Visitation Program (GDVP)](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/diversity/programs/graduate-diversity-visitation-program/) for a chance to visit Purdue and our lab with all expenses covered for four days. You can reach me at samunozg{at}purdue[dot]edu
